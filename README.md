## What is Marching Squares?
[This wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) not only provides a better description than what I could probably give, it also provides some useful tables and details on how you can write your own implementation.


**The idea is this:**
We have an isovalue, and we want to draw lines through a square that would semi-accurately depict where the isovalue would cut through the square based on the current and neighboring squares' values.
